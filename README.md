# The Heap
A place for me to put miscellaneous algorithm implementations and toy problems â€” if it's too small to merit its own repository, it goes here. 

This feels too informal for a proper license file, but feel free to use it for whatever, with attribution (CC-BY, I suppose). 

## snake-89
A simple clone of the classic video game *snake*, written entirely using technology that existed in 1989. (ncurses, C89 and plain Makefiles). I would not recommend this choice for serious game development unless you are insane.

## cypher
Simple Caesar cypher implementation, made as an excuse to learn the `boost::program_options` c++ library. 

## life
You know this one: it's Conway's game of life, everyone's favorite beginner - intermediate programming project! The 'backend' program logic is in c++ and the display frontend is in Python, which is a ridiculous approach for something so small, but I wanted to try out `boost::python` in a low-stakes environment. 

### one-off
Single file projects, mostly implementations of algorithms I found interesting. Disposable and minimally documented.
